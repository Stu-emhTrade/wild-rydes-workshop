# Backend API
You'll now add the backend service for handling ride requests from *Wild Rydes* users. You'll create an HTTP API that will take requests from your frontend. The backend will reserve a unicorn and direct it to your user's location. Your backend API will use API Gateway to handle HTTP requests plus a Lambda function to process the request. You'll also see the Stackery environment variables you previously configured.

## AWS Services

<!-- FIXME: link to Stackery resource docs? -->

- AWS API Gateway
- AWS Lambda
- AWS Systems Manager (SSM) Parameter Store.
- AWS Secrets Manager


## Instructions
Go back to the terminal in the root of the *stackery-wild-rydes* stack directory. Re-start the visual editor by typing `stackery edit`.


### 1. Add a Rest API resource
Add a Rest API resource to the application stack. Click **Add Resources** and then click on the Rest Api resource. This will add an AWS API Gateway to your stack which will handle web requests to the backend service.

<!-- FIXME: We should explain CORS -->
Double-click on the newly added resource, which should be named *Api*, to open up its configuration. Modify the **Routes** setting so there is one route, a `POST` action to the `/ride` endpoint.

Next check off **ENABLE CORS**. Scroll down to the bottom and hit the **Save** button.

### 2. Add a Function resource to service API requests

When a *POST* request is made to the */ride* endpoint it should trigger a Lambda function to perform an action. You will add this function and connect the *Api* resource to this function so a web request will trigger it.

Add a Function from the *Add Resources* menu and then click on the newly added resources in the visual editor. Change the **LOGICAL ID** to `RequestUnicorn` and the **SOURCE PATH** to `src/RequestUnicorn`.

![Function](./images/04-function.png)



Scroll down to **ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES**. Add one named `UNICORN_STABLE_API` in the `Key` field. On the right in the dropdown that says **Literal** change it to **Param** and then enter the value `unicornStableApi`. This will have Stackery pull the value for *unicornStableApi* that you entered in Environment Parameters in the previous module. Then click **Save**.

Next, draw a line from the *POST /ride* resource inside the *Api* resource to the *RequestUnicorn* Function.

### 3. Add a Table resource for saving ride records

Add a Table resource from the *Add Resources* menu and click on it to open the table's configuration. For **LOGICAL ID** enter `Rides` and for **HASH KEY NAME** enter `RideId` and then save settings.

![DynamoDB Table](./images/04-dynamosb-table.png)

Next drag a wire from the right side of the *RequestUnicorn* Function to the *Rides* Table. This will add the `TABLE_NAME` environment variable so the function can access the table and adds permissions for the function to manipulate records.

### 4. Add a Secrets resource to *RequestUnicorn* Function

Add a Secrets resource from the *Add Resources* menu to allow the *RequestUnicorn* Function to access the Unicorn Stablesâ„¢ API key. Drag a wire from the right side of the *RequestUnicorn* Function to the new Secrets resource. This adds a permission for the function to read secrets from AWS Secrets Manager. It also adds an environment variable `SECRETS_NAMESPACE` to make it easier to locate the correct secrets for the environment the stack is deployed into.

### 5. Point *PopulateFrontendContent* Function to the *Api* URL.

Drag a wire from the right side of the *PopulateFrontendContent* Function to the left side of the *Api* resource. Doing this adds the `API_URL` environment variable to the function. The *PopulateFrontendContent* Function uses the environment variable to generate *js/config.js* as part of the website content.

### 6. Authorize requests using the User Pool Client

Requests to *POST /ride* must have a valid User Pool authentication token in the `Authorization` header. Unfortunately, this is something that isn't nicely abstracted by AWS SAM yet, so we will manually edit the *Api* resource settings.

For this step, we will be directly editing the `template.yaml` template file at the root of our stack. Open that file in your IDE.

![Template file](./images/04-template-file.png)

In the template file, find the *Api* resource (it will be named *Api* and have a *Type* attribute with the value `AWS::Serverless::Api`). You can use *Ctrl+f* to search the file for this. Add the following authentication configuration under the *Properties* key.

```YAML
Auth:
  Authorizers:
    WildRydes:
        UserPoolArn: !GetAtt UserPool.Arn
```

Next locate the *POST /ride* route under *DefinitionBody -> paths -> /ride -> post* path in the YAML and add the following *security* property:
```YAML
security:
  - WildRydes: []
```

> YAML is very unforgiving of indentation mistakes. Make sure your indentation is exactly the same as shown below before saving your changes.

The complete *Api* resource definition look like it does below. *(NOTE: the order of the properties doesn't matter)*
```YAML
  Api:
    Type: AWS::Serverless::Api
    Properties:
      Auth:
        Authorizers:
          WildRydes:
            UserPoolArn: !GetAtt UserPool.Arn
      Name: !Sub
        - ${ResourceName} From Stack ${StackTagName} Environment ${EnvironmentTagName}
        - ResourceName: Api
      StageName: !Ref EnvironmentAPIGatewayStageName
      DefinitionBody:
        swagger: '2.0'
        info: {}
        paths:
          /ride:
            post:
              security:
                - WildRydes: []
              x-amazon-apigateway-integration:
                httpMethod: POST
                type: aws_proxy
                uri: !Sub arn:aws:apigateway:${AWS::Region}:lambda:path/2015-03-31/functions/${RequestUnicorn.Arn}/invocations
              responses: {}
      EndpointConfiguration: REGIONAL
      Cors:
        AllowOrigin: '''*'''
        AllowHeaders: '''Authorization,Content-Type'''

```

Be sure to save your changes to the `template.yaml` file.


### 7. Update *RequestUnicorn* Function.

Update the *RequestUnicorn* Function code so it is functional. The code accepts requests and performs the following actions:

* Retrieves the username from the *Authorization* header from API Gateway
* Retrieves the Unicorn Stablesâ„¢ API key from AWS Secrets Manager and caches the value for subsequent requests
* Makes a request to the Unicorn Stablesâ„¢ endpoint to rent a unicorn
* Records the ride to the *Rides* DynamoDB table
* Returns with the response to the frontend website request

Copy [src/RequestUnicorn/index.js](src/RequestUnicorn/index.js) from the workshop directory (also created in module 1) into your project directory.

*Note: Make sure you are still in the stackery-wild-rydes project directory when you run the following command. You can stop the local server with `CTRL+C`, then enter:*

```bash
cp ../wild-rydes-workshop/src/RequestUnicorn/index.js ./src/RequestUnicorn/index.js
```

If you open `./src/RequestUnicorn/index.js`, you will see the updated code:

![Function code](./images/04-function-code.png)

### 8. Deploy updated Wild Rydes

You'll now deploy the updated *stackery-wild-rydes* stack:

```bash
stackery deploy --strategy local -e development --aws-profile <your-aws-profile-name>
```

Once again, this will take a couple of minutes.

### 9. Request a unicorn

When your deployment is done, head back to the *Wild Rydes* website (with `/ride.html` added to the address). If the error message from module 2 is still up, refresh the page. Then right click on the map to drop a pin. After that click **Request Unicorn**. A unicorn will fly in from the edge of the screen towards your location pin. Huzzah! ðŸ¦„
